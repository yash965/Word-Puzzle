This word-puzzle game challenges students to answer questions by selecting the correct options. As feedback for selecting the correct options, animations like stopping rain or starting snow play, making learning interactive and engaging.

To streamline level creation, I built a custom Unity tool. The tool enables designers to:
1. Create and edit levels using custom inspector
2. Manage words, define correct solutions
3. assign animations
4. preview setups without entering Play mode.

The tool follows: **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern**, using ScriptableObjects for data, event actions for communication.
